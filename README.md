# Problem Description 

Given an integer array containing digits from [0, 9], the task is to print all possible letter combinations that the numbers could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is being followed. Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any letters. All the mapping are shown in the image below:
